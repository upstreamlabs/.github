# Upstream Labs

**Building Sustainable Open-Source Ecosystems**

Upstream Labs is devoted to building sustainable open-source ecosystems. We work at the intersection of technology, policy, and public good—training ecosystem builders, convening cross-sector partners, and supporting projects that serve as digital public infrastructure.

We believe open source is more than a technical pathway—it is a collaborative civic culture that cultivates trust, shared value, and long-term sustainability so collective innovation can power a shared future.
